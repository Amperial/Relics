# A config for a set-variable trigger that rerolls an item's variance.
# arguments are variance difficulty (v), and a random number from 0 to 1 (x).
#
# the variance is set based on the following process:
#     pick a random number "x" from 0.0 to 1.0
#     calculate the new variance with x and difficulty (v) using the following:
#     variance = ((x^v) * (v-1) / v) + (x/v)
# this equation allows the resulting variance value to scale from 0 to 1.
# the variance difficulty adjusts the distribution of the resulting variance values.
# by setting v = 1, the resulting variance is equal to the random number (y = x)
# increasing v will change the curve so that y is increasingly less than x. for example:
#     ________________________________________________
#     When v = 1:
#     desired variance | 0.2+  | 0.4+  | 0.6+  | 0.8+
#     percent chance   | 80    | 60    | 40    | 20
#     average tries    | 1.25  | 1.67  | 2.5   | 5
#     ________________________________________________
#     When v = 2:
#     desired variance | 0.2+  | 0.4+  | 0.6+  | 0.8+
#     percent chance   | 69.38 | 47.53 | 29.58 | 13.99
#     average tries    | 1.441 | 2.104 | 3.381 | 7.148
#     ________________________________________________
#     When v = 3:
#     desired variance | 0.2+  | 0.4+  | 0.6+  | 0.8+
#     percent chance   | 56.48 | 34.98 | 20.5  | 9.29
#     average tries    | 1.527 | 2.859 | 4.878 | 10.76
#     ________________________________________________
#     When v = 5:
#     desired variance | 0.2+  | 0.4+  | 0.6+  | 0.8+
#     percent chance   | 37.66 | 21.24 | 11.93 | 5.26
#     average tries    | 2.655 | 4.708 | 8.382 | 19.01
#
# This system allows for an item's variance distribution to be chosen based on how good the item is:
#     A very poor item should have a v of 1 or even less than 1.
#     A normal item should have a v of between 1 and 3.
#     A very strong item should have a v of at least 5, no more than 20.
