NEW TODO:
======
- #{config} is the only way right now
    - add #{config(arg1, arg2, ...)} to specify new args to be passed to the subconfig
- Actually fancy equipment system
- enchantments and other basic item features
- heroes class requirements
- texture pack generation (base + models -> generated) (abstract away durabilities, use model names)

NEAR FUTURE ORDERED TODO:
=========================
- Polish lore stuff
    - allow group attribute to sort lore also per-attribute instead of just per-attribute-type

- transformer to generate attribute type tags based on standard attribute name->type config

- Item Leveling (attribute, system)
    - add levelUp(int amount) method to each attribute type
    - add level-up attribute
        contains attribute types to be leveled up upon item level up, and by how much for each type
    - on item level up:
        remove all gems from sockets temporarily. level these up on their own if they have their own level-up attributes
        for all attributes, levelUp(amount defined in level-up attribute for the type, if defined)

ITEM EQUIPMENT:
===============

4 armor slots
27 storage slots
9 hotbar slots
off-hand slot

armor can be equipped by right click or placing into the slot

Each player has a configurable map of equippable slots
These slots can each have a single item of a certain type (armor types, main weapon, ring, etc.) equipped at any given type.
Certain slot types should only exist once (armor types etc.), while others are configurable (rings, etc.)

Equippable slots can be mapped to inventory slots.
Items equipped to mapped slots must stay in the mapped inventory slot.
If no item is currently equipped to a mapped slot, the inventory slot does not have to be empty or contain a custom item.
If an item is in a mapped slot when an item is equipped to that slot, the item in that slot is moved elsewhere in the inventory.
Equippable slots are not required to be mapped to inventory slots, these item can exist anywhere in player's inventory (rings, etc.)
Certain equippable slot mappings cannot change (armor types etc.), while others are configurable by plugin configs and each player (main weapon etc.)

Currently equipped items cannot be modified (edit gems, settings, etc). The player must unequip the item to modify it.
Currently equipped items cannot be manually dropped or moved outside of player's inventory (plugin can drop if player dies etc. though)

Item Equipment needs to handle the cases of other plugins causing items to move out of mapped slot or even player's inventory.
===============

ITEM SETS:
==========
Items can be part of configurable item sets which makes the items stronger if player has multiple items of the set equipped.
