Projectiles:
- Put projectile item on projectile entity metadata when fired

Item Variables:
- Global variables on the item, that can be used in attributes
- Variables can be referenced with config transform system
    - Attributes with values that support this will hold an object that must be evaluated
        - If something uses a variable, the variable's current value will be used every time the setting is evaluated
        - If something doesn't use a variable, the static value will just be wrapped for evaluation with the same code
- Necessary for item upgrade system, allowing item values to change after generation
- Used for item level, rarity, and other possibilities such as varying how good the item is, storing energy, etc
