IMPORTANT:
- Give all items in items.yml a constant uuid, separate from the actual id that can be random per instance
    - For revoking all items of a certain type, even if they are different unique instances

Core Systems:
- Equipment
- Item Variables

Attributes:
- Item Set bonuses
- Damage Mitigation

Triggers:
- Periodic trigger
- Take damage (or attacked by entity)
- Attack entity
- Kill entity

Triggerables:
- EffectLib effects
- Bukkit effects
- Skills
- Send message to command sender
- Fire players out of bows

Trigger Results:
- TriggerResult enum implements Result, Result has TriggerResult getResult, onTrigger returns Result

Projectiles:
- Put projectile item on projectile entity metadata when fired
- Add trigger for triggerables that listen to projectile hit event

Item Variables:
- Global variables on the item, that can be used in attributes
- Variables can be referenced with config transform system
    - Attributes with values that support this will hold an object that must be evaluated
        - If something uses a variable, the variable's current value will be used every time the setting is evaluated
        - If something doesn't use a variable, the static value will just be wrapped for evaluation with the same code
- Necessary for item upgrade system, allowing item values to change after generation
- Used for item level, rarity, and other possibilities such as varying how good the item is, storing energy, etc

General QoL:
- Add option to set an item's max stack size
    - Have to listen to all sorts of events to accomplish this without breaking functionality of other items
